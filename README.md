# ContactsList
# Author: Vilma Heikkil√§
A simple command line contacts list for maintaining knowledge of people's names, user names,
and 5-digit user codes in some imaginary user base. You can print a list of contacts, add new contacts,
remove contacts, and sort the list by either names or user codes. People can have the same names,
but each code is unique.

GUI still to be added ":D"

Used TableIt library https://github.com/SuperMaZingCoder/TableIt by SuperMaZingCoder for printing information. Check their repo to see how to get the library working.
